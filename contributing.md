## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

- Additionally to PSR-2 we use `$snake_case` for variable naming and `camelCase()` for methods

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation is updated.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Breaking functionality will be tagged accordingly when merged.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- We prefer to have an accessible demo environment for showing changes.
